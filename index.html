        <h2>Goal and purpose of this website</h2>
        <p>The main goal and purpose of this camping website is to have visitors who would like to be
            informed about the different ways you can have fun whether it is with your family or with 
            close friends. This website is to bring attention to the different materials and the different
            tools that you may find yourself needing to enjoy a fun, and safe experience while camping.
            <p>Daniel Boone once said:
            <blockquote>"I have never been lost, but I will admit to being bewildered for several weeks"</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>So our goal is to make sure that no one is either lost nor bewildered and have everything that they could possibly need to have a good time.
