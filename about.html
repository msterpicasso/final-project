            <h4>About the creator</h4>
            <p>
                Our founder, Joshua Cox, is a beginner camper himself and wanted to find a way to help other beginner campers like himself. He didn't know
                where to start or where to look for the different materials and the different advice so he could enjoy his camping experience in the safest way possibe.
                So, he created this website for the many different people out in the world who probably ended up in the same situation or predicament just like him.
